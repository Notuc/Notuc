## About Me

I'm a **Mathematics & Computer Science** graduate; I like solving fun challenges that combine mathematics with programming to tackle many diffrent problems, in gaming, finanace, low-level dev, etc.

```cpp
class Nathan {
  public:
    string education = "B.S. Mathematics & Computer Science";
    vector<string> interests = {
      "Quantitative Finance", "Robotics", "Systems", 
      "AI", "Physics", "Applied Mathematics"
    };
    string current_project = "Building production-ready distributed systems";
    int book_collection = 324; // Send recommendations! 📚
};
```
